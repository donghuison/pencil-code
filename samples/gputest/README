To clone Pencil Code together with Astaroth:
--------------------------------------------
git clone --recurse-submodules https://<github username>@github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git
cd $PENCIL_HOME/src/astaroth/submodule
git merge origin/master

To add Astaroth later to already installed Pencil Code:
-------------------------------------------------------
cd $PENCIL_HOME
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd src/astaroth/submodule 
git checkout master

To build with Astaroth:
-----------------------
On Clusters, an appropriate CUDA (for NVIDIA devices) or HIP (for AMD) module must be loaded, perhaps also CMake.
Set 

GPU            = gpu_astaroth
GPU_VENDOR     = [nvidia|amd]     # nvidia is default
MULTITHREADING = openmp

in Makefile.local. At first time, this implies to repeat pc_setupsrc.

The build has three stages:
1) build Pencil Code as usual by make or pc_build - will fail at first during link stage because shared object
   astaroth_[sgl|dbl].so is found to be missing;
2) to obtain the missing object, go to src/astaroth and call make - will build three shared objects;
3) return to working directory and repeat build of Pencil Code - only the linker stage will be performed (fast)

To run:
-------
In SLURM, set the following in the sbatch-script:
--ntasks          = <total number of MPI processes = total number of GPUs employed>
--ntasks-per-node = <...> # ideally the number of all GPUs per node
--cpus-per-task   = <...> # ideally the number of CPUs per node, divided by ntasks-per-node
--gres            = gpu:<device type>:<ntasks-per-node>

Also, there are usually separate partitions for GPU use.
On some imperfectly configured machines, additional settings are required.
