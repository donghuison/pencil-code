	Test that ensures that (at least some part of) the code doesn't implicitly
	assume cp==1. This setup is identical to conv-slab, except that cp is set
	to 2 (and hcond0 is doubled). If the code correctly handles cp/=1, the
	results should be identical to those of conv-slab (as long as we consider
	ss/cp rather than ss in the diagnostics).
