	Test that ensures that (at least some part of) the code doesn't implicitly
	assume cp==1. This setup is identical to cartesian-convection-kramers-chimax,
	except that cp is set to 2 (and hcond0 is scaled appropriately). The
	diagnostic precision has been increased since the Kramers conductivity
	only seems to have a very small effect on the results.
