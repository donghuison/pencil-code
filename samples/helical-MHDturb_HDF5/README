Comments:
    Identical to helical-MHDTurb, except that io_hdf5 is used (and we use
    mpicomm since nompicomm does not work with hdf5_io_parallel). The purpose
    is to test whether the Python routines in pc.read work with HDF5 simulations.
    The current reference data are the same as in the standard (nohdf5,
    nompicomm) sample. Note that in the Python module, the HDF5 2D averages are
    transposed (x-z) as compared to the io_dist ones: with HDF5, the axis
    ordering of yaver is [t,z,x]; while without HDF5, it is [t,x,z].
    
    I have also removed the lzero_spec_zerok option from power_spectrum_run_pars
    to get the sample to work on my somewhat older development branch.
